# Moon Orbits Simulation

This folder contains simulations of the Moon's orbital motion around Earth, demonstrating fundamental concepts of orbital mechanics and celestial motion.

## Files Overview

### Indonesian Version (First Version)
- **OrbitBulan.py** - Basic Moon orbit simulation with simple circular motion

### English Version (Enhanced/Improved)
- **MoonOrbits.py** - Enhanced Moon orbit simulation with stars and labels *(improved version of OrbitBulan.py)*

## Physics Concepts

### Orbital Motion
The simulations demonstrate circular orbital motion using basic trigonometry.

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
x = r · cos(θ)
y = r · sin(θ)
```

Where:
- r = orbital radius (distance from Earth)
- θ = angular position (angle in radians)
- (x, y) = Moon's position coordinates

**Angular Motion:**
```
θ(t) = θ₀ + ωt
ω = dθ/dt = angular velocity
```

**Conversion:**
```
θ_radians = θ_degrees × π/180
```

### Real Moon Orbital Data
- **Average distance**: ~384,400 km from Earth
- **Orbital period**: ~27.3 days
- **Orbital speed**: ~1.022 km/s

### Simplified Model
The simulation uses a simplified circular orbit model:
```
Period = 2π/ω
Angular_speed = 360°/steps_per_orbit
```

## Features Comparison

| Feature | Indonesian Version | Enhanced Version |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Background** | Plain black | Starfield with 150 stars |
| **Earth** | Simple blue circle | Labeled Earth with fixed position |

| **Visual Effects** | Basic graphics | Enhanced with stamps and trails |
| **Code Structure** | Simple animation | Organized with functions |

## Orbital Mechanics Principles

### Kepler's Laws (Simplified)
1. **First Law**: Orbits are elliptical (simplified to circular here)
2. **Second Law**: Equal areas in equal times
3. **Third Law**: Period² ∝ Distance³

### Centripetal Force
For circular orbits:
```
Fc = mv²/r = mω²r
```

Where:
- Fc = centripetal force
- m = mass of orbiting body
- v = orbital velocity
- ω = angular velocity

### Gravitational Force
```
Fg = GMm/r²
```

Where:
- G = gravitational constant
- M = mass of Earth
- m = mass of Moon
- r = orbital distance

For stable circular orbit: Fg = Fc
